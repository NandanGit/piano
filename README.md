## How to use

1. To generate natural notes use the bottom most row in the keyboard
2. To generate sharp/flat notes use the above keys accordingly
3. To change the damping time of the notes, use the slider in the middle
4. To select octaves from 0-8 use the left and right sliders, left one varies from 0-7 and the right one varies from 1-8 (left and right octaves are always adjacent)
